Phaser, global background different states
==========================================
This is a html5/javascript test using the Phaser framework.

The goal is to create a background and fade in/out effect for several Phaser.state objects.
The background and fade effects are created using separate global functions, so that they can be re-used in different state objects.
Another goal is to use as few resources as possible so it doesn't interfere with the rest of the game.
